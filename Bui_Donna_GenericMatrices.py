# Generic Matrices - Donna Bui - 4/14/2023 - Professor Henry Estrada's COMSC 078
# This program will add and multiply matrices and implement abstract methods into concrete subclasses for operations on specific types of matrices (Integer and Rational). 
# I modified the docstring comments under some of the methods based on how I interpreted the instructions on Canvas.

# For this program, I will assume that the following rules apply:
# 1. Only matrices with the same dimensions can be added.
#    E.g. A 3x2 matrix cannot add with a 2x3 matrix. A 3x3 matrix can add with a 3x3 matrix.

# 2. Matrices with differing dimensions can be multiplied as long as they meet the column/row equality requirement. They do not have to be equal in size/dimension.
#    E.g. A 3x2 matrix can multiply with a 2x3 matrix. Other functional combinations that will be tested in this program (in addition to the ones provided on Canvas) include 3x2 and 2x4, 3x3 and 3x2.
#    Using a*b and c*d to represent the dimensions of matrix 1 and matrix 2 respectively (in terms of row * column), the following conditions must be true:
#    b = c and a*d will equal the size of the result matrix after multiplying.

# 3. Only matrices of the same type will be added/multiplied with each other, 
#    E.g. An integer matrix will not be added/multiplied by a rational matrix

# 4. Matrices will only contain its designated type of number.
#    E.g. An integer matrix will not contain any rational numbers and vice versa.
